# Hi everybody, it's my  first network on Python (I've never used Python before, so don't scold for my code style, it will be better, i promise).
# I didn't want to use any frameworks like tensorflow or keras, because I wanted to understand principle of neural network's work. Don't be strict please and leave comments. I love constructive criticism))
